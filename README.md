# tkinter-openpyxl-excel-updator
Basic script that uses `tkinker` and `openpyxl` packages. User input is taken from the tkinter generated GUI.
When the `UpdateXL` buttom is clicked and there is user input, the excel worksheet is updated if the workbook exists else a new workbook is created.
The user can repeat the taking of information and updating the excel sheet severally whilst the app is run.
The `Clear` button is used to clear the entries at any time. 
The updated excel sheet can be seen when the user closes the app.

More functionalities can be added, and refactoring can be done; especially using `OOP paradigm`.
